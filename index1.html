    <div class="coloring"><p>Java is a general purpose programming language designed with one mantra in mind—”write once, run anywhere.” Java applications are compiled into bytecode that can run on implementations of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JVM helps bridge the gap between source code and the 1s and 0s that the computer understands. Any machine that has the JVM installed can run Java. In web development, Java features most prominently as a server-side language and the programming language of choice for mobile apps on the Android platform. It also still has a decent presence on the front-end as a Java applet, although this is falling out of favor due to security concerns.

    <div class="leftspace"><p> JavaScript:Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript (standardized as ECMAScript) is considered one of the big three core components of the web. Employed by a majority of websites, JavaScript is a scripting language that typically runs in the browser and makes web pages dynamic and interactive. Today JavaScript is also quickly growing as a server-side technology since the release of Node.js in 2009.

    <div class="leftspace coloring"><p>Java vs. JavaScript: Major similarities
As different as they are, there are some top level similarities worth considering, especially if you are looking at web development when comparing Java to JavaScript.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Both languages require the developer to code in terms of objects and their relationships to one another. By extension this gives both languages access to techniques like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Front-End Development. Both languages can be used in aspects of front-end development. JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML, implemented as a framework or library; Java can be used as a Java applet.
Back-End Development. Both languages can be used on the server-side. Java has long been used to power back-end technologies like Apache, JBoss, and WebSphere. Node.js has become a launch pad for JavaScript-powered servers.

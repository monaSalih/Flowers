Iris (plant)

   <br>
<p>Irises are a favourite with gardeners and are known for their beautiful, colorful blooms. The name of the flower originates from Greek mythology. Iris was the Greek goddess of the rainbow and messenger to the Gods.
 The iris flower was so named in the 14th century because of the spectrum of colors of the many species.

  <h2>HOW TO PLANT IRISES</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>For bare-root irises, plant the rhizome horizontally with the top exposed. </li>
  <li>Plant rhizomes singly or in groups of three, 1 to 2 feet apart, depending on the size.</li>
  <li>Dig a shallow hole 10 inches in diameter and 4 inches deep. </li>
  </ul>

Do not overwater irises; too much moisture in the soil can cause the rhizomes (roots) to rot. Water consistently and deeply, especially during summer drought.
